* Introduction
** Who am I?
My name is Elis Hirwing and I live here in Stockholm.

I've been using Emacs for about 10 years. Some parts of the configuration is
probably almost the same as it was 10 years ago. But I've been migrating
between repositories and configuration formats over time.

We plan to have the next meetup during the spring, but at this point in time
we don't have a place to be or a date. But we'll keep you posted in the
meetup group.
