* Repo of presentation slides I've held in public
All the presentations are written in org-mode and then exported to beamer
slides using texlive.

All the deps and configuration needed to build these presentations are
embedded within the repository and you can use the provided =build.sh= file
to build any presentation within the repo by typing something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build.sh directory-name/presentation.org
#+END_SRC

Then you get a file named =directory-name/presentation.pdf=.
